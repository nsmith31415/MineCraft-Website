<span class="begintext">These are the most common hostile mobs of the overworld that you will find. They <b class="dont">will not</b> hesitate to explode, shoot you, eat your brains, or jump on you. The spider, on the right, is sometimes passive in daylight, but will still attack you if you attack it first. These creatures are usually referred to as "mobs." These mobs can only spawn during the night, during storms(when there is lightning and thunder), in caves, and other places where there is not much light.

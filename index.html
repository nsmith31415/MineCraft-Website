	<h3>History of Minecraft</h3>

<p>Minecraft is a Sandbox game. This means that there is no right or wrong way to play. It was origionally made to be played in single player survival mode, where you would mine, craft, and build whatever you want. Later on though, they added multiplayer mode, where you could join some of your friends on an online server, and people also started creating mods, or modifications. Mods are additions to the game someone else coded in java so it would be possible to do more, less, or play differently in the game. More recently, servers started using code to change what could be done on the servers, making mods for servers, but they are called plugins. These plugins could change permissions of players, for example a player could claim territory, and other players couldnt build or destroy there. There have also been many servers to start making minigames, like capture the flag or hunger games, in Minecraft.</p></div>
